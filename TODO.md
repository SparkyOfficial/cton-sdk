## ðŸš§ PROJECT STATUS
**The CTON-SDK project is currently in ALPHA state.** The architecture and structure are complete, but most functionality is implemented as placeholders. Core components need proper implementation to work with real TON data and networks.

## Critical Issues to Address
- [ ] Update TODO.md to reflect actual implementation status
- [ ] Implement proper memory management in native interface to prevent leaks
- [ ] Replace placeholder cryptographic implementations with real Ed25519
- [ ] Implement proper BOC serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Fix TON address parsing and formatting
- [ ] Implement real contract functionality (Jetton, NFT, Wallet)
- [ ] Fix CMakeLists.txt to properly integrate OpenSSL
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests with real data verification
- [ ] Refactor TonApiClient to eliminate code duplication
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and resource management

## Future Enhancements (Optional Long-term Goals)
- [ ] Integration with existing TON libraries
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Support for other cryptographic algorithms
- [ ] Mobile platform support (Android/iOS)
- [ ] WebAssembly compilation target
