## Modules to Implement

### Module 1: ton-sdk-core
- [x] Cell and CellBuilder (C++ and Java)
- [x] Address handling (C++ and Java)
- [~] Cryptography (Ed25519 implementation with OpenSSL) - Placeholder only
- [~] Mnemonic codes (placeholder implementation)
- [~] BOC parser and builder (partial implementation)
- [~] Unit tests (placeholder tests with minimal coverage)

### Module 2: ton-sdk-api-client
- [x] HTTP client for TON Center API
- [~] LiteClient implementation (placeholder using HTTP instead of ADNL)
- [~] Methods for get-methods, block/transaction info (incomplete)
- [x] sendBoc implementation
- [x] Asynchronous operations support

### Module 3: ton-sdk-contract

- [~] Message factory (partial implementation)
- [~] Contract wrapper generator (placeholder implementation)
- [x] Jetton standard support (real implementation)
- [x] NFT standard support (real implementation)

## Documentation
- [x] README.md with multilingual descriptions
- [x] LICENSE file
- [~] ARCHITECTURE.md with module descriptions (missing)
- [~] DEVELOPMENT.md with build instructions (missing)
- [x] API documentation
- [x] Examples and tutorials
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines

## ðŸš§ PROJECT STATUS
**The CTON-SDK project is currently in BETA state.** The architecture and structure are complete, with most core functionality implemented. Some advanced features still use placeholder implementations and need refinement for production use.

## Critical Issues Addressed
- [x] Update TODO.md to reflect actual implementation status
- [x] Implement proper memory management in native interface to prevent leaks
- [ ] Replace placeholder cryptographic implementations with real Ed25519
- [ ] Implement proper BOC serialization/deserialization
- [x] Fix TON address parsing and formatting
- [x] Implement real contract functionality (Jetton, NFT, Wallet)
- [x] Fix CMakeLists.txt to properly integrate OpenSSL
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests with real data verification
- [x] Refactor TonApiClient to eliminate code duplication
- [x] Implement proper error handling and resource management

## Future Enhancements (Optional Long-term Goals)
- [ ] Integration with existing TON libraries
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Support for other cryptographic algorithms
- [ ] Mobile platform support (Android/iOS)
- [ ] WebAssembly compilation target
